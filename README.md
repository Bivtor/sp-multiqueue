### Summary

One of my main gripes with asking Siri to do things (other than that it usually doesnt work at all) is that Siri can't recognize two seperate commands in the same prompt seperated by a word like 'and'. This was the primary motivator for this project, and using the accurate and cheap NLP processing provided by openai's gpt-4o-mini REST endpoint, creating an interface with spotify that allows multiple songs to be queued through one command was simple! The website is published and fully functional, but unfortunately Spotify bans all AI related interactions with its API, meaning that production access is prohibited, and the site is only functional to whitelisted emails.
